            Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
            The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br>
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.

            Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the 
            products we build are always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as 
            business requirements evolve.
